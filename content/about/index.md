Hi, I'm a Taiwanese Master's student studying in Computer Science. I've loved FPS games and football since I was a kid. During my undergraduate years I wasn't really into learning and just did the bare minimum to pass my classes. Then I realized playing Valorant every day wasn't going to work out -- it was a waste of time, and I felt so guilty about it. I needed to find something that could reignite that spark in my eyes and keep me grinding until I lose track of time, just like making games in Scratch did for me in my middle school years.
