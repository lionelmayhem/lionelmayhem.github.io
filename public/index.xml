      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m a Taiwanese Master&amp;rsquo;s student studying in Computer Science. I&amp;rsquo;ve loved FPS games and football since I was a kid. During my undergraduate years I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really into learning and just did the bare minimum to pass my classes. Then I realized playing Valorant every day wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to work out &amp;ndash; it was a waste of time, and I felt so guilty about it. I needed to find something that could reignite that spark in my eyes and keep me grinding until I lose track of time, just like making games in Scratch did for me in my middle school years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
